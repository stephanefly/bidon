# Expose your business logic as services here.
# See https://github.com/HackSoftware/Django-Styleguide#services
# Services as domain sit between API(views) and Database
#
# Try to name your services functions with the pattern <entity>_<action>
# for example where <entity> is the model name :
#    harness_create()
#    harness_calculate()
#    ...
#
# Service can be implemented as class too, but think twice before adding
# this extra complexity.
